## 🎓 Methodology

### 5 Pillars of Day Trading
This software implements the "5 Pillars of Day Trading" methodology for stock selection, based on research from trading strategies that identify stocks with:
- High probability momentum setups
- Sufficient liquidity for day trading
- Volatility for profit potential
- Recent catalyst for price movement
- Technical pattern confirmation

**Learn more:**
- Educational resources on day trading strategies
- Technical analysis fundamentals

### Dark Flow Scanner Methodology
The Dark Flow Scanner uses **volume profile analysis** to detect institutional activity:

**How It Works:**
1. **Volume Profile Creation** - Divides price range into 20 bins and aggregates volume at each level
2. **Key Level Identification** - Finds price levels with highest trading activity (institutional accumulation/distribution)
3. **Unusual Volume Detection** - Identifies volume spikes 2+ standard deviations above average
4. **Gap Analysis** - Detects price gaps over 1% and classifies them
5. **Bias Determination** - Calculates bullish/bearish bias from price vs. open

**Use Cases:**
- Identify where institutions are building positions (support levels)
- Find resistance where institutions may be distributing (selling)
- Spot "signature prints" - large block orders in major ETFs
- Confirm technical analysis with volume validation
- Find optimal entry points near institutional levels

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on major ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA) for clearest signals
- Volume clusters within 0.5% of current price are most actionable
- Combine with VWAP/MACD analysis for highest-probability setups
- Unusual volume often precedes major price moves

### Technical Analysis
The technical analysis implementation (VWAP, MACD, SMA+ATR) is original work by the author:

**VWAP Bands:**
- VWAP = Volume Weighted Average Price
- Standard deviation bands show support/resistance
- Price position indicates overbought/oversold conditions

**SMA + ATR Bands:**
- Used for FOREX/crypto when volume data unavailable
- 20-period Simple Moving Average
- ATR-based bands (1x and 2x ATR)
- Automatically detected and applied

**MACD:**
- 12/26/9 default settings
- Crossovers signal potential entries
- Histogram shows momentum strength

## ⚡ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"TradingView screener not available"**
```bash
pip install tradingview-screener
```

**"Could not analyze [ticker]"**
- Check ticker symbol is correct (use proper format)
- Ensure internet connection
- Some assets may have insufficient data
- FOREX tickers need =X suffix (e.g., EURUSD=X)
- Crypto tickers need -USD suffix (e.g., BTC-USD)

**"No stocks/pairs/crypto found in scan"**
- Markets may be quiet
- Try different market selection
- Adjust timeframe
- Check internet connection

**Dark Flow Scanner Issues**
- Works best with liquid assets (stocks with high volume)
- Major ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA) provide clearest signals
- Requires at least 10 data points for volume profile
- Some assets may have insufficient historical data

**Rate Limiting**
- Yahoo Finance may throttle requests
- Wait a few minutes between large scans
- Use scanner results multiple times (option 5)

**FOREX/Crypto Data Issues**
- Some pairs may have limited historical data
- Try different timeframes
- Ensure correct ticker format
- System automatically switches to SMA+ATR when volume unavailable
