# trading-signal-analyzer
A stock scanner and analyzer to help learn day trading. You will get an idea of where to enter, take profit, and stop loss. Use at your own risk. This is NOT financial advice. It is for training purposes only. If you use this to learn how to pick and analyze stocks, use "paper trading" instead of real money.
